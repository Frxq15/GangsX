    Hey Dan, this is the class you wanted to work on.
    You basically just need to fill in all the methods with your code that makes it do whatever it's supposed to do.
    As this is the SQLGangDataFactory, you could guess it's all about making this work with an SQL Database (and only
                                        covering the gang objects, the players are going to be handled independently).

    You can look at what the methods are supposed to do, by looking at the methods tooltips or reading the java docs I
    wrote in the GangDataFactory class (which this file is extending).

    It would be smart to add some sort of Map in this class which stores the UUID -> Gang (<UUID, Gang>), which would
    kind of be used as a cache (loadGangData, unloadGangData and isGangDataLoaded are methods that are related to that;
    getGangData should pull from the cache, if it contains the gang, instead of querying).

    There is no need to worry about making anything asynchronous as this is covered by the parent class (Methods such
    as initializeGangDataAsync which call the normal methods asynchronously and return the result as CompletableFuture).

    If you have any questions feel free to message me on Discord (kleinesNugget#5354 ðŸ™‚)

    Yours sincerely
